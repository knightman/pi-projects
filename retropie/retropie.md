# retropie

Old school gaming on the pi.

#### Description

This is probably the simplest project I've ever done on the raspberry pi. You can find details about the project [here](https://retropie.org.uk/). They have many good resources for helping you with setup so I won't bother replicating it.

#### Basic Instructions

Download the pre-built image and copy to SD card. You also need to find some ROM files for your favorite games from various online sources. Finding ROMs that worked well was the hardest part of this project. The good news is that I don't have to blow the dust out of the game cartridge before booting up the game! I do recommend getting a wireless controller. Have fun!
