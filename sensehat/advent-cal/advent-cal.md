### advent-cal
Simple advent calendar app using the Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat.

#### Description
My son keeps asking me how many days until Christmas! The old fashioned Advent calendars with little doors that were opened daily to reveal a holiday-themed picture is what we used to use to count down the days to Christmas. I started looking around for a more modern version and I found this niftly little project on Raspberry Pi website. We built it together in acouple hours.

#### Instructions
Take your Pi and hang it on your tree. Optional: decorate it to look festivate :)

Run advent-cal.py and when the joystick on the sense hat is pressed, it will display a fun holiday character on the led matrix and show the remaining days until Christmas.
