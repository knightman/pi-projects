#### Description
My son keeps asking me how many days until Christmas! The old fashioned advent calendars with little doors that were opened daily to reveal a holiday-themed picture is what we used to use to count down the days to Christmas. I started looking around for a more modern version and I found this niftly little project on Raspberry Pi website. We built it together in acouple hours.
